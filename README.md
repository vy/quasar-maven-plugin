**Warning!** Due to lack of time and [Quasar developers' unwillingness to
distribute this plug-in in the official Quasar release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/quasar-pulsar-user/GzvktONJkpY/t1_MmdcLAgAJ),
**I AM NOT MAINTAINING THIS PLUG-IN ANYMORE.** (Further, I am not even sure if
Quasar itself is maintained at all.) That being said, I would be more than happy
to handover the project to someone else stepping up.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vy/quasar-maven-plugin.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/vy/quasar-maven-plugin)

[Quasar](http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/) is a Java library that
provides high-performance lightweight threads, Go-like channels, Erlang-like
actors, and other asynchronous programming tools. Quasar fibers rely on bytecode
instrumentation. This can be done at classloading time via a Java Agent, or at
compilation time. This project ships a Maven plugin for the ahead-of-time Quasar
instrumentation of the compiled class files.

Usage
=====

Configure the plugin to instrument the code:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.vlkan</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <check>true</check>
        <debug>true</debug>
        <verbose>true</verbose>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>instrument</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```
